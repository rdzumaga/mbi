Step by step instructions how to run unit tests for client (javascript) in bioweb 0.06
----------

This tutorial assumes that you already have working bioweb installation (“scons r=l” works).

1. Build application using SConstruct: navigate to folder with bioweb and do __“scons”__
2. After the aplication build has successfully finished, do __“scons t=j”__ to run client unit tests. Tests outcome will be available at __biowebfolder/client/unit\_test\_out.html__.
3. Tests are done using QUnit test framework (javascript). Outcome html lets you view all run tests functions and their outcome. Failed tests are marked red. Standard information like each test run-time, number of tests run, passed & failed counts are provided. Passed tests can be hidden and list can be filtered by test module.
4. You can enable coverage by ticking option up top, this will calculate and show coverage in percent for each tested file. There are also option to check for globals and disable try-catch.
5. Example tests are located in __biowebfolder/client/tests__. File srv.py contains script to start web server for testing purposes, actual tests are in located .js files.
6. After creating your own .js test files, you must include them into testing. To do that, open file __biowebfolder/client/unit_test.html__ and, alongside other test files include commands, add: 
~~~~~~
 <script src="path_to_your_test_file" data-cover></script>
~~~~~~
7. Remember that after any changes you must re-build your application using __“scons”__ before running tests again with __“scons t=j”__
8. When running tests with __“scons t=j”__, there is an attempt to open, __by default, google chrome__ browser to display the results. To change default browser you must edit file SConstruct located in main bioweb folder. By default, at line 18 there is a #web section, followed by definition of browsers to be opened under Windows and Linux OS. Change this setting to open your browser of choice.
