"""
	The stages in the FASTA algorithm are as follows:
1. We specify an integer parameter called ktup (short for k respective tuples), and we look
for ktup-length matching substrings of the two strings. The standard recommended
ktup values are six for DNA sequence matching and two for protein sequence matching.
The matching ktup-length substrings are referred to as hot spots. Consecutive hot spots
are located along the dynamic programming matrix diagonals. This stage can be done
effciently by using a lookup table or a hash to store all the ktup-length substrings from
one string, and then search the table with the ktup-length substrings from the other
string.

2. In this stage we wish to find the 10 best diagonal runs of hot spots in the matrix. A
diagonal run is a sequence of nearby hot spots on the same diagonal (not necessarily
adjacent along the diagonal, i.e., spaces between these hot spots are allowed). A run
need not contain all the hot spots on its diagonal, and a diagonal may contain more
than one of the 10 best runs we find.
In order to evaluate the diagonal runs, FASTA gives each hot spot a positive score,
and the space between consecutive hot spots in a run is given a negative score that
decreases with the increasing distance. The score of the diagonal run is the sum of the
hot spots scores and the interspot scores. FASTA finds the 10 highest scoring diagonal
runs under this evaluating scheme.

3. A diagonal run species a pair of aligned substrings. The alignment is composed of
matches (the hot spots) and mismatches (from the interspot regions), but it does not
contain any indels because it is derived from a single diagonal. We next evaluate
the runs using an amino acid (or nucleotide) substitution matrix, and pick the best
scoring run. The single best subalignment found in this stage is called init1. Apart
from computing init1, a ltration is performed and we discard of the diagonal runs
achieving relatively low scores.

4. Until now we essentially did not allow any indels in the subalignments. We now try to
combine \good" diagonal runs from close diagonals, thus achieving a subalignment with
indels allowed. We take \good" subalignments from the previous stage (subalignments
whose score is above some specied cuto) and attempt to combine them into a single
larger high-scoring alignment that allows some spaces. This can be done in the following
way:
We construct a directed weighted graph whose vertices are the subalignments found
in the previous stage, and the weight in each vertex is the score found in the previous
stage of the subalignment it represents. Next, we extend an edge from vertex u to
vertex v if the subalignment represented by v starts at a lower row than where the
3.3. BLAST - BASIC LOCAL ALIGNMENT SEARCH TOOL 3
subalignment represented by v ends. We give the edge a negative weight which depends
on the number of gaps that would be created by aligning according to subalignment v
followed by subalignment u. Essentially, FASTA then nds a maximum weight path in
this graph. The selected alignment species a single local alignment between the two
strings. The best alignment found in this stage is marked initn. As in the previous
stage, we discard alignments with relatively low score.

5. In this step FASTA computes an alternative local alignment score, in addition to initn. Recall that init1 denes a diagonal segment in the dynamic programming matrix. We
consider a narrow diagonal band in the matrix, centered along this segment. We observe
that it is highly likely that the best alignment path between the init1 substrings, lies
within the subtable dened by the band. We assume this is the case and compute
the optimal local alignment in this band, using the ordinary dynamic programming
algorithm. Assuming that the best local alignment is indeed within the dened band,
the local alignment algorithm essentially merges diagonal runs found in the previous
stages to achieve a local alignment which may contain indels. The band width is
dependent on the ktup choice. The best local alignment computed in this stage is
called opt.

6. In the last stage, the database sequences are ranked according to initn scores or opt
